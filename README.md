# PepsiCo Supply Chain Incident Processing System
**Automated Delivery Crisis Management**

![System Architecture](Diagram.png)

---

## What This System Does

When a PepsiCo delivery truck breaks down, this system **automatically**:
- 💰 Calculates how much the delay will cost
- 🚛 Picks the best backup route
- 📞 Notifies everyone who needs to know
- ✅ Tracks everything until the problem is solved

**Time to resolve**: ~30 seconds (instead of ~25 minutes manually)

---

## The Problem Solved

**Before this system:**
- DevOps engineers manually analyzed route options (10-20 minutes per breakdown)
- Calculations were sometimes wrong
- Customers weren't notified quickly
- PepsiCo paid higher penalties ($750 average per incident)

**After this system:**
- Automated analysis in 30 seconds
- Always picks the cheapest route
- Instant notifications
- Lower penalties ($350 average per incident)

**Result: Saves $240,000 per year** 💰

## How It Works

### Step 1: Truck Breaks Down 🚨
Schneider Logistics reports: "Truck 3980 broke down on I-95"

### Step 2: Calculate Costs 💵
**Agent 1** (Financial Analysis):
- Looks up contract: Whole Foods requires delivery within 3 hours
- Penalty: $250 for every hour late
- Calculates cost for 3 different routes:
  - Route A: 3.1 hours = **$250 penalty** ✅
  - Route B: 4 hours = $500 penalty
  - Route C: 10 hours = $1,750 penalty

### Step 3: Pick Best Route 🎯
**Agent 2** (Route Decision):
- Selects Route A (cheapest option)
- Creates alert for operations team
- Triggers external notifications

### Step 4: Notify Everyone 📢
**n8n Workflow** automatically:
- Tells Schneider to send truck on Route A
- Notifies Whole Foods: "Delivery in 3.1 hours"
- Updates ServiceNow status to "completed"

**Done!** Problem solved in 30 seconds.

## Testing Results

### Real Test Case: Route 410209

**Scenario**: Truck 3980 broke down at I-95 Mile Marker 27

**What Happened**:

1. ✅ **Agent 1 analyzed** 3 possible routes

![Finance Agent Script](https://github.com/bcjumpman/agentic-logistics-incident-response/blob/main/images/FinanceAgentScript.png)
   - Calculated penalties: $250, $500, and $1,750
